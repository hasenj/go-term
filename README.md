Flexible building blocks for a TUI application

- Can take raw text (containing escape seqences) as input and display it
  in a rectanble on the screen
- Allows defining the UI in immediate mode style.
- Basic keyboard and mouse event handling

Limitations:

- Lack of rich widget library; you must implementing most things
  yourself
- POSIX only for now; no windows support
